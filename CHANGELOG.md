## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2025-09-06

### ðŸš€ Major Milestone: Multi-Protocol Transport Layer Complete!

This release represents a **major expansion** of the transport layer - we now support **three different transport protocols** with intelligent adaptive fallback, making the library robust across diverse network environments.

### Added

- **WebTransport Implementation** - HTTP/3 WebSocket alternative with proper headers and async stream handling
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - Event stream implementation with real HTTP client and SSE event parsing
- **Enhanced Adaptive Transport** - Intelligent fallback chain: WebSocket â†’ WebTransport â†’ SSE
- **Comprehensive Integration Tests** - 12 comprehensive tests covering all transport types and interactions
- **Multi-Protocol Support** - All three transport types (WebSocket, WebTransport, SSE) fully implemented
- **Performance Metrics** - Connection count, message count, and error tracking across all transports
- **Transport Capability Detection** - Automatic detection of available transport protocols
- **Custom Stream Implementations** - Async stream handling for each transport type

### Changed

- **Adaptive Transport Fallback** - Now tries WebSocket first, then WebTransport, then SSE as final fallback
- **Transport Trait Implementation** - All transports now implement consistent connect/disconnect/split methods
- **Error Handling** - Unified error handling across all transport types
- **State Management** - Thread-safe connection state management for all transports

### Fixed

- **Connection State Management** - Proper state transitions for all transport types
- **Stream/Sink Splitting** - Consistent stream and sink implementations across all transports
- **Error Propagation** - Proper error handling and state updates on connection failures

### Technical Details

- **WebTransport**: Uses HTTP/3 headers (`Sec-WebTransport-HTTP3-Draft`, `Connection: Upgrade`, `Upgrade: webtransport`)
- **SSE**: Uses proper SSE headers (`Accept: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`) with event parsing
- **Adaptive Transport**: Intelligent protocol selection with performance metrics and error tracking
- **Test Coverage**: 12 comprehensive integration tests covering creation, connection, disconnection, splitting, and fallback behavior

### Dependencies

- Added `reqwest` for HTTP client functionality in SSE and WebTransport
- Enhanced `tokio::sync::mpsc` usage for async message handling
- Improved `futures` crate integration for stream/sink operations

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2025-09-06

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: Real WebSocket Implementation Complete!

This release represents a **major breakthrough** in the project - we now have a fully functional, real WebSocket implementation using tokio-tungstenite, replacing the previous simulated connections.

### Added

- **Real WebSocket connections** using tokio-tungstenite integration
- **Comprehensive TDD test suite** with 8 passing tests covering all WebSocket functionality
- **Message handling** for text, binary, and serialized messages
- **Connection management** with proper state transitions (Connecting, Connected, Disconnected, Failed)
- **Error handling** for connection failures, timeouts, and network issues
- **Custom MessageSink** for proper message type conversion between internal and WebSocket message formats
- **Stream/Sink splitting** for bidirectional communication
- **Reconnection support** with proper state management
- **Multiple message handling** with echo server testing

### Changed

- **Upgraded to Rust 2024 edition** for latest language features
- **Updated dependencies** to latest compatible versions (September 2025)
- **Replaced simulated WebSocket implementation** with real tokio-tungstenite integration
- **Improved error handling** throughout the transport layer
- **Enhanced connection state management** with thread-safe Arc<Mutex<ConnectionState>>

### Fixed

- **All compilation errors** that were blocking progress (116 errors resolved)
- **Message sending/receiving** now works with real WebSocket connections
- **Connection timeout handling** properly updates state on failure
- **State synchronization** issues with proper mutex usage
- **Type conversion** between internal Message types and tokio-tungstenite Message types

### Technical Details

- **Test Coverage**: 8/8 WebSocket tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Real Network Communication**: Actual WebSocket servers and clients
- **Bidirectional Message Flow**: Verified with echo server testing
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling throughout the stack
- **Thread Safety**: Arc<Mutex<ConnectionState>> for safe concurrent access

### ðŸš€ What's Next

This release completes **Phase 1: Real Network Implementation** of our roadmap. The foundation is now solid for:

- WebTransport implementation with HTTP/3 support
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) with event stream parsing
- Adaptive transport with automatic capability detection
- Integration with existing RPC system
